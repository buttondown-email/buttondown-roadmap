This is Buttondown's public roadmap and issue tracker. Please feel free to watch, comment on, or create issues (though please don't be offended if I close or modify them!)

The issue tracker can be a large and daunting place. Some useful filters to help you navigate:

- [Filtering to `bugs` shows you all known bugs](https://github.com/buttondown-email/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
- [Filtering for `selected for development` shows you everything I'm working on in a given week](https://github.com/buttondown-email/roadmap/labels/selected%20for%20development)
