This is Buttondown's public roadmap and issue tracker. Please feel free to watch, comment on, or create issues (though please don't be offended if I close or modify them!)

The issue tracker can be a large and daunting place. Some useful filters to help you navigate:

- My current [slew of feature work for the quarter](https://github.com/buttondown-email/roadmap/milestone/1)
- [Filtering to `bugs` shows you all known bugs](https://github.com/buttondown-email/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
- [Filtering for `selected for development` shows you everything I'm working on in a given week](https://github.com/buttondown-email/roadmap/labels/selected%20for%20development)

If you're interested in the specific [labels](https://github.com/buttondown-email/roadmap/labels) I use, here's a handy primer:

| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **bug** | Items labeled `bug` are, well, bugs. I tend to take these pretty seriously. |
| **documentation** | Items labeled `documentation` are improvements to [docs.buttondown.email](https://docs.buttondown.email). (Did you know that was [open source](https://github.com/buttondown-email/docs)?) |
| **ergonomics** | Items labeled `ergonomics` are fixing paper cuts and making things just a little _nicer_.  |
| **feature** | Items labeled `feature` are brand-new functionality. I am pretty surgical and persnickety with this work: I try to be very mindful of when and how to grow Buttondown's surface area, with the full understanding that with each new feature comes complexity. |
| **integrations** | Items labeled `integrations` are integrations with other services like Slack, Zapier, or IFTTT. |
| **marketing** | Items labeled `marketing` are marketing in the 'classic' sense — ways to better improve the placement and representation of Buttondown in the larger newsletter ecosystem! I know it's odd to put this on the "roadmap" but I think it's a useful reflection — I want the roadmap to be adequately representative of how and where I spend my time. |
| **operations** | Items labeled `operations` are meant to be internal — checkers to make my alerting infrastructure better, scripts to speed up annoying tasks, that sort of thing. Again, you probably don't need to care about this: but it's transparent, right? |
| **pending** | Items labeled `pending` are blocked on some other thing, whether it's a Buttondown thing or exogenous. |
| **performance** | Items labeled `performance` are about making Buttondown _faster_, both on the frontend and the backend side. |
| **technical debt** | Items labeled `technical debt` are about improving the codebase and internal abstractions, so as to speed up future development flows. |
| **zapier** | Items labeled `zapier` pertain to Buttondown's [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/buttondown/integrations). |
