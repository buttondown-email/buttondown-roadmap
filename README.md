This is Buttondown's public roadmap and issue tracker. Please feel free to watch, comment on, or create issues (though please don't be offended if I close or modify them!)

The issue tracker can be a large and daunting place â€” for us, the people who _build_ Buttondown, let alone hapless bystanders and spectators! We've got two things to make it a little bit easier:

1. The [long-term roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/buttondown/projects/8), a quarterly projection of major projects we're shipping over the next twelve months.
2. The [bug tracker](https://github.com/orgs/buttondown/projects/8/views/4), which is a slightly more pleasant way of poking around the issue tracker


We also do a pretty good job of organizing things [by label](https://github.com/buttondown/roadmap/labels):

- **Modules** are distinct functions of the code base (editor, analytics, API);
- **Types** are distinct genres of issue (bug, feature, documentation)
