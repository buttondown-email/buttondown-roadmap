This is Buttondown's public roadmap and issue tracker. Please feel free to watch, comment on, or create issues (though please don't be offended if I close or modify them!)

If you're interested in what I'm working on in a given point in time, I'd recommend filtering by [selected for development](https://github.com/buttondown-email/roadmap/labels/selected%20for%20development).
